        <h1>Week 01 Notes Master Mobile UX</h1>
        <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Design for the smallest and least powerful first, then content and functionality.</li>
            <li>Personal computers have been on the decline since 2011, meanwhile mobile usage has skyrocketed</li>
            <li>Average person has 2-3 devices per person, per household</li>
            <li>Eric Schmidt: do mobile first from 2012</li>
            <li>Responsive retrofitting: No touch interaction, goes from big screen to small</li>
            <li>Mobile first: Small screen to large, provides best experience across many devices, future friendly</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Be immediate: if the site isn’t available for mobile, customer will be lost</li>
            <li>Be relevant: needs to serve their needs, only 9% will stay</li>
            <li>Be quick: reduce cognitive load of user. </li>
            <li>Reduce the amount of steps users need to do</li>
            <li>Reachability: 75% of people rely on their thumb. Reachability and buttons matter. Keep key items near the bottom of the screen</li>
            <li>Google: ½ second delay = 20% drop in traffic</li>
            <li>Bing: 2 second delay = 4% drop in revenue</li>
            <li>Aol: Fastest users stay 50% longer</li>
            <li>Faster responses keep users engaged</li>
            <li>3G mobile speeds are the majority of the global market at nearly 25% compared to 4G at 1.8%, design for less loading</li>
            <li>Lower image quality and usage</li>
            <li>SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth</li>
            <li>Optimize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Menu and Nav should be at bottom</li>
            <li>Facebook moved menu towards bottom and the user perception thought the app was faster</li>
            <li>Menu with a border had 20% increase in clicks compared to hamburger menu</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Use placeholder text inside labels to reduce the need of outside labels for forms or float labels</li>
            <li>Only ask for information needed</li>
            <li>Enable auto complete on forms to prevent errors</li>
            <li>Show password by default, and allow option to hide</li>
            <li>Use correct keyboards for applications, such as numbers only for telephone</li>
            <li>Use hyperlink to allow users to tap and make a phone call</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lesson 5</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Don’t have popups to restrict content, loses customers</li>
            <li>Ads shouldn’t take more than 40% of the screen, start with small one that users can tap to enlarge.</li>
            <li>Content should come first</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Design for mobile first, then scale up to desktop</li>
            <li>Mobile is the largest and growing factor within consumer technology</li>
            <li>Optimize website by reducing unnecessary CSS and JS, reducing the number of images, and GZIP files for data</li>
            <li>Forms should use floating labels along with only asking for the required information</li>
            <li>Ads shouldn’t take priority over the content space on a mobile site</li>
        </ul>
